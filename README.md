# Ibit: The Infinite Information Unit

**Whitepaper v1.1 – by Zenith**

---

## Overview

**Ibit (∞bit)** is a revolutionary new unit of information that transcends both classical bits and quantum bits. Unlike traditional data systems, the Ibit exists in a manipulable, non-collapsing quantum state — **containing all possible informational states simultaneously**.

This whitepaper introduces the Ibit as a concept and as a future foundation for infinite-density computing, resonant information extraction, and pre-form matter manipulation.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Ibit ≠ Bit ≠ Qubit**
- Infinite density, zero collapse
- Readable through resonance algorithms
- Encoded by potential, not position
- Exists in an undefined quantum material layer

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **manifesto and technical starting point** for those interested in:

- Post-quantum computing concepts
- Information theory beyond binary/qubit limits
- Fractal logic and ontological information structures
- Conscious-system design and storage models of the future
